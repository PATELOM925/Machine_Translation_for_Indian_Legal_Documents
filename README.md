# Machine Translation for Indian Legal Documents 
 
## 📜 Project Overview
This project aims to bridge the gap in legal accessibility by creating a machine translation framework for **Indian legal documents**. Our solution simplifies and translates complex legal jargon into accessible and accurate text using state-of-the-art **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models. 

We also built a **custom legal corpus of 2,500 terms**, tailored specifically for Indian legal contexts, to enhance the accuracy of translation and summarization tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Legal Corpus Development**:
  - Curated a dataset of 2,500 plus Indian legal terms with annotations for translations, simplified meanings, and contextual usage.
- **Machine Translation**:
  - Implemented multilingual translation using models like **MBART** for Indian legal texts.
- **Legal Text Simplification**:
  - Utilized **Google Pegasus** and **T5-Base** for summarizing complex legal clauses into concise and readable forms.
- **Custom Preprocessing**:
  - Designed a pipeline to tokenize, substitute, and adapt legal terminology for better machine learning performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Assessed translation and summarization accuracy using **BLEU** and **ROUGE** scores.
